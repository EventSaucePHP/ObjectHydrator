### Deprecations

- The `ObjectHydrator` class was deprecated, use `ObjectMapperUsingReflection` and hint against the new `ObjectMapper` interface.
- The `ListOfObjects` class was deprecated, use the `IterableList` object instead.
- The `KeyFormattingWithoutConversion` class was deprecated, use the `KeyFormatterWithoutConversion` class instead.

### Breaking Changes

- The `ObjectHydrator` class was converted into an interface named `ObjectMapper`, the main implementation is `ObjectMapperUsingReflection`.
- The `PropertyDefintion` class was renamed to `PropertyHydrationDefinition` to be symmetrical with the new `PropertySerializationDefinition`.
- The `DefinitionProvider::provideDefinition` method was deprecated in favour of the new `provideHydrationDefinition` for symmetry with `provideSerializationDefinition`.
- The `KeyFormatter` interface was changed by adding a `keyToPropertyName` method, needed for serialization.
- The `ObjectHydrator::hydrateObjects` return type class was renamed from `ListOfObjects` to `IterableList`.

### Added

- The `ObjectMapper` interface was introduced, which represents both generated and reflection based mappers.
- [Major Feature] Serialization was added to the main `ObjectHydrator` interface.
- Array hydration now also has rudimentary support for docblock type hints (`@param Type[] $name`, `@param array<Type> $name`, `@param array<string, Type> $name`).
